  #This section simulates data
  #Don't be too concerned about *how* this works, only what it is doing:
    #We are taking 1,000 samples of data (an X and Y variable) and running a regression on each
    #Confidence intervals around our estimates of the effect of X and Y should contain the true value of that effect 95% of the time (or 90, 99, etc.)
    #We know that the true effect of X on Y is 2; this is defined in the simulation
      example <- data.frame(x = rep(NA,1000),
                             se = rep(NA,1000))
      
      for (i in 1:1000) {
        x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
      
        b0 <- 0
        b1 <- 2
        e = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 2)
        
        y <- b0 + b1*x + e
        
        lm <- lm(y ~ x)
        example$x[i] <- summary(lm)$coefficients[2,1]
        example$se[i] <- summary(lm)$coefficients[2,2]
      }
  
  #In real data analysis, we would only be able to look at one model
      #This summary and coefplot only looks at the last sample drawn.

      #We can calculate a 95% confidence interval around that estimate by taking the estimate Â± (1.96 * Standard Error)
      #That interval will contain the true estimate (2) 95% of the time across repeated samples
      #Does it in this case?
      
  
  #The "example" dataframe contains the estimate and standard error for all 1,000 of our random samples

  #If theory is correct, 95% of the 95% confidence intervals will contain the value 2
