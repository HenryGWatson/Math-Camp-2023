# What is the formula for a beta coefficient?

    #Summation of "demeaned" X times "demeaned" Y
    #divided by Summation of "demeaned" X squared
  
  #Take the mean of the independent variable and subtract from the actual values
  x_mean <- mean(data$x)
  data$x_demean <- data$x - x_mean
  
  #Take the mean of the dependent variable and subtract from the actual values
  y_mean <- mean(data$y)
  data$y_demean <- data$y - y_mean
  
  #Multiply the demeaned X and Y
  data$xtimesy <- data$x_demean * data$y_demean
  
  #Take the sum across all observations
  numerator <- sum(data$xtimesy)
  
  #Square the demeaned X and sum across all observations
  data$x_demeansq <- data$x_demean^2
  denominator <- sum(data$x_demeansq)
  
  #Divide Summation of "demeaned" X times "demeaned" Y by 
    #Summation of "demeaned" X squared

  #When do we have larger values of beta?
    #When the numerator is large (positive or negative) and the denominator is small
  
  #When is the numerator large?
    #Numerator is very similar to covariance of X and Y
    numerator / (nrow(data) - 1)
    cov(data$x,data$y)
    #When X and Y are both signed the same, X times Y is positive
    #When X and Y are signed differently, X times Y is negative
    #Remember, we're working with demeaned data
    #If X and Y have no relationship, you will have a lot of positive *and* negative values, 
      # so the sum will be close to 0
